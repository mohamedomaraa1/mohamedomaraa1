### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Data Engineer** with a strong foundation in data pipelines, data modeling, and automation using modern data tools and cloud technologies.  
I enjoy transforming raw data into clean, reliable datasets for analytics, AI, and business insights.

💡 I have a genuine passion for **Data Engineering** — from ingestion and transformation to orchestration and optimization.

📚 I'm currently enhancing my skills through the **Data Engineering track at ITI**, working on real-world projects and mastering modern tools and architectures.  
With a blend of hands-on project experience and a commitment to continuous learning, I focus on designing and optimizing data systems using both batch and real-time architectures.
